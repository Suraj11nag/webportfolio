Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to data science in my last year at [RajaRajeswari College of Engineering, Bengaluru](https://www.rrce.org/) where I completed my Bachelors in Engineering (2016-2020) with [7.2 CGPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dYkenPoC75M6_wMY6p-lEZAi2zMBun0j/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a data analyst for [Open Financial](https://open.money/) contributing to the Engineering Department. In this role, my primary responsibilities involve implementing automation for reporting and alerts through Looker, ensuring real-time data analysis and keeping teams informed of changes.

Previously, I worked with the Engineering and Product Team at [Mojocare](https://mojocare.com/). My responsibilty includes automating tasks, creating dashboards, integrating and designing the event architecture for analytical platform and developing models to accomplish and measure business goals.

Previously, I worked closely with the Product Team at [Eloelo](https://m.eloelo.in/), fostering and improving products and services for our users by using advanced analytics.

I also worked as an Engineering Intern at [Bosch Rexroth](https://www.boschrexroth.com/en/in/), where I performed analysis on several business channels such as consumer experience, product & service marketing.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
